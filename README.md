## Description
Welcome to our component-based-development project "Christmasshop" in the Wintersemester 21/22. 
Our goal was to implement a project consisting of various services representing an online shop for delightful Christmas decorations.<br>

The full project includes:
* Application Microservice
* Calculator Service
* Storage Service
* Gateway Service
* Frontend Service

Which can all be found as submodules to this repo.

## Installation and Run

Apart from the frontend, all services in this project require [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to run. <br>
After cloning the repos and once Maven is installed, enter 

```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
in your terminal.<br>

The frontend requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run. <br>

```sh
cd <projektfolder>
npm install
```
To start the server
```sh
npm start
```
And open the app in your favourite browser (we recommend [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/thanks/)) via ```localhost:3000 ```.
